# Todo List API using Java Spring Boot

This is a simple Todo List API built using Java Spring Boot. The API allows you to manage tasks by providing endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting tasks.

## Features

- Create a new task.
- Update a task (mark as completed or incomplete).
- Delete a task.
- Get a list of all tasks.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-list.git
```

2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).

3. Run the Spring Boot application.

4. The application will start a server on a specified port (e.g., localhost:8080).

## How It Works

- The API provides endpoints for handling CRUD operations on tasks.
- You can use API clients like Postman to interact with the API and perform CRUD operations.

## API Endpoints

- `POST /todos`: Create a new task. Request body should contain task details in JSON format.
- `PUT /todos/{id}`: Update a task by ID. Request body should contain updated task details in JSON format.
- `DELETE /todos/{id}`: Delete a task by ID.
- `GET /todos`: Get a list of all tasks.

## Dependencies

- Java JDK 8 or higher.
- Spring Boot framework.
